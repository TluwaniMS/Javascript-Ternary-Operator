# Javascript-Ternary-Operator

The `Ternary operator` is a simplified/shortened way of writing out a conditional operator `if/else`

`
(condition to be met) ? (logic to be executed if condition is met) : (logic to be executed if condition isn't met)
`

```
const greet = false;

greet ? console.log(`I've been instructed to greet you :)`) : console.log(`I'm sorry I can't talk to strangers :(`);

///Will print:
I'm sorry I can't talk to strangers :(
```

```
const color = `Green`;

color === "Green" ? console.log(`The color chosen was Green!`) : console.log(`The color chosen wasn't green!`);

///Will print:
The color chosen was Green!
```
